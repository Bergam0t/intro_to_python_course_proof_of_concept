This is a small proof-of-concept repo looking at how to make an interactive programming course using

- Quarto
- [Quarto Pyodide](https://github.com/coatless-quarto/pyodide) - a Quarto extension that allows you to create runnable code cells without requiring hosting by using WASM
- [Webexercises](https://github.com/psyteachr/webexercises/) - a  Quarto extension that allows you to create various interactive types of questions (with [this fork](https://github.com/Bergam0t/webexercises) allowing feedback as well)

The original intention was to publish it when several chapters were complete, but due to a lack of time to continue working on it at present, I'm making it available now in case the template is of use to anyone else!
