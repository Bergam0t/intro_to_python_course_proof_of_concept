There are a lot of things that get taught early on in courses that I've never gone on to use

I feel like they're quite offputting and take focus away from things you need to get more solid with at that early stage

- tuples
- while loops? I find for and if to be a lot more frequent. maybe mention while in that section but not spend time on it? link to the section but have it in an appendix or similar?
- sets
- other methods of file import outside of pandas import methods
- decorators
- generators
- reading excel spreadsheets
- quarto for reproducible outputs
- a short overview of things you might want to learn next depending on your sort of role (targets pipeline work,
- an overview of the benefits of R and why you might want to know both
- an overview of other languages and where/why you might encounter them (html, javascript, css, typescript)




misc things to make sure are included
- drop duplicates and distinct/unique
- the argument when importing to pandas to determine what is a na value
- dropping and replacing nas 
- imputation
- replacing na values
- kinds of joins
- list appends
- pandas concat method
- counting dataframe length
- absolute and relative filepaths
- environments
-
