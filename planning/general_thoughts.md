There are a lot of things that get taught early on in courses that I've never gone on to use

I feel like they're quite offputting and take focus away from things you need to get more solid with at that early stage

- tuples
- while loops? I find for and if to be a lot more frequent. maybe mention while in that section but not spend time on it? link to the section but have it in an appendix or similar?
- sets
- other methods of file import outside of pandas import methods
- decorators
- generators





misc things to make sure are included
- drop duplicates and distinct/unique
- the argument when importing to pandas to determine what is a na value
- dropping and replacing nas 
- imputation
- replacing na values
- kinds of joins
- list appends
- pandas concat method
- counting dataframe length
- absolute and relative filepaths
- environments
- - reading excel spreadsheets
- quarto for reproducible outputs
- a short overview of things you might want to learn next depending on your sort of role (targets pipeline work,
- an overview of the benefits of R and why you might want to know both
- an overview of other languages and where/why you might encounter them (html, javascript, css, typescript)
- apis
- f strings (i feel like this is generally easier than format? so maybe introduce first]
- lambda functions
- dealing with outputs of variable lengths
- parameterised reporting
- writing formulas into excel spreadsheets
- good practice for incorporating tests into join and filtering operations
- renaming columns 
- calculating the percentage of a total by category
- look for strings containing in pandas
- why should you consider learning python if you already know r
- an overview of data science and machine learning techniques and the sorts of questions you could apply them to in healthcare
- making simple static maps
- making simple interactive maps
- correlation
- EDA
- why python instead of drag and drop BI platforms
- simple statistics (t test, anova, p values, confidence intervals, multiple comparisons/p hacking )
- forecasting
- dashboarding and app creation platforms
- common graph types with value in healthcare
- rules and tips for good graphs
